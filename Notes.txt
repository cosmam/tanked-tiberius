If you see the string [##########] you want to merge that from your current settings file.


GameUserSettings.ini:

This is how you set dino levels. This will set them to max out at 120 IIRC
DifficultyOffset=1.0
OverrideOfficialDifficulty=4.0

The 4.0 gets multiplied by 30 to set max level. I recommend starting lower and only raising as you level. The Island is current at 7.0. Tek can spawn higher

AllowMakingWeaponsAndArmorBPs=TRUE lets you use the blueprint maker to destroy an item to turn it into a blueprint. If you don't want to allow this, you can just remove this line


Game.ini:

SupplyCrateLootQualityMultiplier=2.000000 gives better items; I usually raise it to 3 or 4 during events
